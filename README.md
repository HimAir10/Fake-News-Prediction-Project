# Fake-News-Prediction-Project - I made my new project of "Fake News Prediction" which predicts the binary output as the input news is fake or real . In this project i used Logistic Regression supervised learning concept of machine learning . The main thing about this Project is the project contains data in string format and we have to first convert the strings into its feature vector and then we feed the data in machine learning model .
